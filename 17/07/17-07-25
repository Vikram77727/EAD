    <p>

        The Dominican Republicâ€™s Imperial Amazon, locally known as the sisserou, is endemic to this Caribbean island and is its national bird. 

The species is critically endangered. In 2019, it was estimated there were only about 50 mature individuals left in the wild, down from a previous count of hundreds. The reason for this was twofold: a serious loss of natural habitat and to make things worse, Hurricane Maria.

Imperial Amazons are about 19 inches long, weighing about 23 oz (females) or 32 oz (males). Rather big for a parrot! As they are very shy, they travel in groups of three at most. Sometimes they feel comfortable enough to  flock together with red-necked amazons. They are good climbers and strong flyers with powerful wings. They prefer to perch on the tops of trees. They are difficult to detect, as they are well camouflaged by their plumage.</P></p>

<p>The imperial amazon is a critically endangered species. There are estimated to be only about 50 mature individuals left in the wild as of 2019.[14] There have been many efforts to help the habitat for these parrots. With the help of Dominica's Forestry, and the Wildlife and Parks Division and the Rare Species Conservatory Foundation (RSCF), areas such as the Northern Forest Reserve and the Central Forest Reserve are protected.[15] However areas adjacent to the Northern Forest Reserve and the Central Forest Reserve remain unprotected.[15] Efforts are being made to help make other areas of Dominica protected. Many of the organizations have helped create groups of people to raise awareness, provide education, and conduct research.[16] The educational programs held in Dominica have reduced the bird trade.[16] The first successful breeding of this species by humans was conducted in 2011.[15] The captive-bred parrot developed fully in 12 weeks and resembled the wild imperial amazon parrots.[17] No one really knew what the reproductive potential of these parrots was. The imperial amazon has the lowest reproductive potential of any of the Amazona species.[17]</p>
